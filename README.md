# ðŸ“Š Data Mining & Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and clustering** using a marketing campaign dataset. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, detect patterns, and segment customers based on their purchasing habits.

## Features

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Creating new features (e.g., `Customer_For`, `Family_Size`, `Age Group`)  

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
- Distribution analysis of `Marital Status`, `Education`, etc.  
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features  
- Spending behavior analysis  

**Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:**  
- Transforming data into 3D principal components  
- Visualizing clusters in reduced dimensions  

**Clustering Techniques:**  
- **K-Means Clustering:** Finding optimal clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
- **Agglomerative Clustering:** Hierarchical segmentation of customers
